# 📘 Quiet Ledger
### You lend. We remember.

Quiet Ledger is a simple, private, and offline-first mobile app that helps you remember who owes you, what they owe, and when it was lent — without awkward reminders or social pressure.

No accounts.
No notifications sent to others.
Just quiet memory.

## ✨ Why Quiet Ledger?

People lend money, items, or favors every day — and forget them just as easily.

Quiet Ledger exists to:
- Help you remember debts calmly
- Avoid awkward conversations
- Keep records private and offline

This app does not chase people.
It simply remembers for you.
